# Prospero

Welcome to the Prospero issue centre. This github repository is intended to be the home for any bugs, feature requests or comments related to the Prospero toolkit. The actual code for Prospero will remain on Maersk's private SSH server.

Please find all current and closed issues under the 'Issues' tab. You do not need a github account to view issues, but you will need to create one to leave a comment or create your own issue.

## Creating an issue

When creating a new issue, please prefix the title with the location of the bug or enhancement in square brackets. For example, [Module I] or [Data Importer] for anything specific to Module I or the Data Importer respectively. Or [General] for an item that is applicable across multiple modules. Each issue can then be labelled, usually the label will be 'bug' or 'enhancement'. 

For bug reports, screenshots of the unexpected behaviour help a lot. The orignal data files for the surfaces, faults, or wells used when experiencing the bug also go a long way to help fixing the bug. Please do not host the data file on issue itself, but instead post the file location of the data files in the issue.
